1. If you live alone and you have symptoms of coronavirus illness (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home for 7 days from when your symptoms started. (The ending isolation section below has more information)".
<br /><br />
2. If you live with others and you are the first in the household to have symptoms of coronavirus, then you must stay at home for 7 days, but all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days. The 14-day period starts from the day when the first person in the house became ill. See the explanatory diagram.
<br /><br />
3. for anyone else in the household who starts displaying symptoms, they need to stay at home for 7 days from when the symptoms appeared, regardless of what day they are on in the original 14 day isolation period. The ending isolation section below has more information, and see the explanatory diagram.
<br /><br />
4. It is likely that people living within a household will infect each other or be infected already. Staying at home for 14 days will greatly reduce the overall amount of infection the household could pass on to others in the community.
<br /><br />
5. If you can, move any vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions) out of your home, to stay with friends or family for the duration of the home isolation period.
<br /><br />
6. If you cannot move vulnerable people out of your home, stay away from them as much as possible.
<br /><br />
7. If you have coronavirus symptoms:
<ul>
    <li> - do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital,</li>
    <li> - you do not need to contact 111 to tell them you’re staying at home,</li>
    <li> - testing for coronavirus is not needed if you’re staying at home,</li>
</ul>
    plan ahead and ask others for help to ensure that you can successfully stay at home and consider what can be done for vulnerable people in the household.
<br /><br />
8. Ask your employer, friends and family to help you to get the things you need to stay at home.
<br /><br />
9. Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, each time using soap and water, or use hand sanitiser.
<br /><br />
10. If you feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home, or your condition gets worse, or your symptoms do not get better after 7 days, then use the NHS 111 online coronavirus service. If you do not have internet access, call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999.
